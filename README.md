ine-Tuning GPT Models with OpenAI API

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune OpenAI’s GPT models (e.g. GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo) to create a customized conversational AI system. The goal is to adapt a base GPT model to a specific domain or style by training it on curated examples in JSONL format.

The repository walks through the full workflow — preparing training data, uploading it to OpenAI, creating and monitoring fine-tuning jobs, and finally using the fine-tuned model for inference. The focus is on understanding the fine-tuning process, improving model performance on domain-specific tasks, and comparing results before and after fine-tuning
